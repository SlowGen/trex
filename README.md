# trex

T-Rex runner!

## Getting Started

Copied from the genius's at FLAME - https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/tree/main/examples/games/trex

This code is adapted as part of a demo for FlutterCon USA 2025

The changes made were only to `trex_game.dart` and a new file I create - `gamepad_controller.dart`. This allows for a gamepad to be connected and used to play the trex game.

The purpose of this adaptation is to demonstrate some basic usage for the `js_interop` library to support inteacting with the web.
